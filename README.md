Jupyter notebook is a reimplement work of Li and Stephens. Hotspotter is the original software developed by authors, my friend helps me to revise their code (adding includes and deleting some mistakes) for correct building and running. P.S. it is compiled under gsl-1.3.0. Trying to directly use binary executable files beyond trying to compile it.
